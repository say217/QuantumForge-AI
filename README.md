# Overview

Ignite your edge in the markets with QuantumForge AI, An enhanced Stock Predictor, It is a comprehensive Python-based system designed for stock price forecasting, technical analysis, and generative AI-driven insights. It leverages deep learning (BiGRU with Attention and Conv1D layers), technical indicators, and integrates with Google's Gemini AI for automated investment reports and a conversational research agent. The system supports real-time data fetching via yfinance, model training, evaluation, multi-day forecasting, and interactive querying for stocks, market news, or deep research topics.

Built for quantitative analysts, traders, and enthusiasts, it provides:

- **Predictive Modeling:** Uses historical data to forecast stock prices with uncertainty intervals.
- **Visualization:** Dark-themed plots for distributions, correlations, test results, and forecasts.
- **AI Augmentation:** Generates professional reports and handles natural language queries.
- **Extensibility:** Modular design for easy fine-tuning or adding new indicators/models.

The project emphasizes reproducibility (seeded randomness), efficiency (mixed-precision training, caching), and usability (conversational CLI loop). **As of the current date (November 25, 2025), it uses up-to-date libraries and assumes access to a GPU for optimal performance.**
